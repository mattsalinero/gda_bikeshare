## Project Overview

This case study focused on using an open dataset of bikeshare ride data to identify distinctions between the usage patterns of paying members and casual riders using the bikeshare. To perform the analysis, the raw data was initially cleaned using excel and then imported into a PostgreSQL database. Next, SQL was used to perform exploratory analysis and pull targeted/aggregated data for visualization in Tableau Public. Ultimately, the results of the analysis were presented in a Tableau Public presentation ([link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/DW443RHCY?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)). Generally, the data shows that members use the bikeshare as a means of transportation (short frequent trips spread throughout the city center) while casual riders mainly use the bikeshare for recreation (longer rides disproportionally involving tourist attractions or parks).
